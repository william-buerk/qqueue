						"How does Type O blood have antibodies against A and B blood types if a type O person has never had A or B type blood in their body? My logic is, in order to make antibodies against anything, you have to be exposed to that something first, and your immune system has to recognize it as a threat and use T cells and B cells to help with the antibody making. My question is... how is it that everyone with type O blood has antibodies when theyâ€™ve never been exposed to type A and type B blood???",
